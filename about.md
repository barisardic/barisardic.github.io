<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am an inspiring academic who believes that the modern software engineering processes can be improved with the effects of cumulative collaborations between academia and industry. My main interests are software engineering education, processes, software analytics. I am fairly active in a team environment and particularly fond of discussing research with others.
</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
    <p>I completed my masters degree under Eray Tüzün in Bilkent University Software Engineering and Data Analytics Research Group. This group provided a team environment with a strong emphasis on collaboration and discussion. Because of this I can say that I have an understanding of the other BILSEN projects besides the one that I was spearheading. 

For my masters thesis, I have worked on how to teach code review best practices to computer science students. To cram in this additional information within the constraints of the Bilkent University software engineering courses, I have come up with a serious game that can be used as a lab platform which simulates code review scenarios allowing us to convey theoretical knowledge while students get to practice their reviewing skills. Of course, to prove the merit of the platform and measure its effects, I had to devise additional evaluation methods. You can follow the evolution of this project from my publications.
</p>
<h1>Hobbies</h1>
 <p> My non-professional interests are mainly cooking and tabletop gaming. I find that cooking is a great place to improvise almost as much as DM’ing a game of DnD for my friends.
